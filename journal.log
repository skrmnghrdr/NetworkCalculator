Realized that I did not need the binary of the octets, I could have just used an "and" operand 
to use anding to them.

2211hrs. Took me hours to debug and realize that the "and" does not equal to & (bitwise) operator.
I did some googling and found out they're different, after solving the issue, i compressed the whole method
into a one liner

Down to the last two remaining tasks of the script would be to figure out how to do the carry over or the
borrowing, I might result into bit by bit addition. it works until you get to the 0 or the 255 where you need to
borrow a bit, that's the only thing missing on the script before it's laid to rest and I start a new project with flask




Oct 10, 2024 1523hrs:
Took me 1.5 hours debugging the whole thing because I missed a [::-1] at one of the variables. I had to manually
look and count each ip.

THe only thing that's left is to return everything in a nice JSON format so it's API friendly
and further clean the code
